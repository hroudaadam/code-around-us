Dijkstra's algorithm is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest
path between an initial and a final node in a graph. This algorithm makes no 
attempt of direct "exploration" towards the destination. It rather expands outward 
from the starting point, interactively considering every node that is closer in 
terms of shortest path distance until it reaches the destination.
