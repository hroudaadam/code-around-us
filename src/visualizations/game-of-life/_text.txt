Convway's game of life is a zero-player game where you observe simulation 
of the two-dimensional grid of cells with two possibl states (alive or dead).
The first generation of the cells is given by the initial pattern. After that
new generation is created with each game tick. There are multiple rules for the 
creation of the new generation base on cell interaction. Some of them might die, 
some of them live on and some of them become alive.
There are multiple initial patterns provided. You can switch between them by
clicking on the visualization.
